# About
Online Test System is a web application that establishes a network between the institute or a teacher and the students. Institute/teacher's are to enter on the site the questions they want in the exam.

Online Test System provides the platform but does not directly participate in, nor is it involved in any tests conducted. Questions are posted not by the site, but users of the site. The site requires an institute/teacher to register before posting the questions.The site has an administrator who keeps an eye on the overall functioning of the system. The sitegets revenue by charging the institute/teacher's each time they want to conduct the exam. The system entitled “Online Test System” is application software, which aims at providing services to the institute/teacher's and providing them with an option of selecting the eligible students by themselves. It is developed by using J2EE technology and related database.
